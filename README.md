This project is currently being worked on 

During my internship, I wanted to have a side project where I could implement all of my ongoing learnings into a side project. Although the company I interened with uses React, I wanted to try Next.js. Being a React framework, I thought it would be perfect to try out.

Frontend - Next.JS and Tailwind
Backend - Next.JS, Firebase/Firestore 
Deploy - Vercel
